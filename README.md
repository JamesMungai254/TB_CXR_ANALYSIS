## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect TB from chest X-ray images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled as TB positive or negative.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JamesMungai254/TB_CXR_ANALYSIS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd TB_CXR_ANALYSIS/
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook TB_ANALYSIS.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The notebook includes detailed analysis and the steps to create a machine learning model for TB detection. The results and performance metrics of the model are also included.
